/*Parameters:
 *unsigned int num - this represents the number you will convert
 *Description:
 *This function converts an unsigned int to binary storing the bits in an array
 *of integers and returns the array. You will need to dynamically allocated the
 *memory for the array of ints.  Suggestion you may want to use calloc to
 *dynamically allocate the memory so that the memory will be initialized.
 *Return:
 *the allocated memory is returned.*/

/*Parameters:
 *unsigned int num - this represents the number you will convert
 *Description:
 *This functions converts an unsigned int to hexadecimal. Remember hexadecimals
 *have characters and not just integers.  The characters should the capital
 *letters. The characters will be stored in an array and the array will be
 *returned.  You will need to dynamically allocated the memory for the the array
 *of characters.
 *Return:
 *the allocated memory is returned.*/

/*Parameter:
 *char* num - this is an array that will hold character value of the output.

 *Description:
 *You will print the hexadecimal value in the following format. (255)
 *00 00 00 FF
 *Your output must look like this. The value above is the equivalent of 4 bytes
 *Return: void
