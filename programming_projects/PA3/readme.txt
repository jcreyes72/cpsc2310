1) Overall the assignment was pretty straightforward and I did not encounter any problems
   other than trying to figure out how I would loop through my binary arrays in order to 
   right shift my values 

2) I solved these problems by writing out my binary arrays on paper so I could visualize 
   what I needed to do in order to solve these issues

3) I thought the assignment was pretty informative as it allowed me to brush up on some pointer
   concepts and passing by reference
