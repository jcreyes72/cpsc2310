1) Problems you encountered with this assignment

I didn't really encounter any problems with the assignment. I hadn't done file writing in 
a while but it's pretty straight forward


2) How you solved the problems

I solved the problems just going off of assignments we had already completed and knowledge 
I already had from being in 1010 and 1020


3) Your thoughts about the assignment. 

The most difficult part of the assignment was how long it took to complete. I feel that 
with the large amounts of work we already had (and still have) this week, as well as the quiz on Friday,
this assigment ensured that I spent the bulk of my day working on C concepts that I already 
felt relatively familiar with. I didn't take away much from the assignment overall. File 
reading and writing is something I already knew how to do from 1010/1020 and once you already
have a solid understanding of file pointers, things like fseek and ftell become pretty straight forward.
I feel that the key takeaways from this entire project could have been summed up just as 
effectively in a much smaller and less time consuming assignment, and that this kept me from 
being able to work on concepts (that may be important for Fridays quiz) that I don't know as well
